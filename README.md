## Motivation behind this Project
### GAN Lab Assignment Instructions
### Objective:
Compare three GAN loss functions and evaluate their impact on an image dataset (CIFAR-10 / CelebA).

### Tasks:
1. Select a Dataset – Use CIFAR-10 or CelebA for training.
2. Implement Three GAN Variants
   * Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) Loss
   * Least Squares Loss (LS-GAN)
   * Wasserstein Loss (WGAN)
3. Train Each GAN Model – Run for at least 50 epochs and save generated images.
4. Evaluate Performance using:
   * Inception Score (IS)
   * Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)
   * Visual Inspection

### MV Lab Assignment Instructions
### Objective:
Apply K-Means and Hierarchical clustering on CIFAR-10 Dataset.
